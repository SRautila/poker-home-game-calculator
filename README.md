MiniZinc implementation to figure out the least amount of transactions necessary to settle the
financials during a home poker game

This is a for fun project I did 8 years after I last touched discrete optimization. Take it for
what it is.

How to use:

1. Download MiniZinc
2. Enter your results in a data file (see the sample data files)
3. Run the solver (tested using OR Tools CP-SAT 9.8.3296)
